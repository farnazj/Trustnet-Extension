                                            Even though on chasing the redirects of some links we may have encountered a CORS issue,
                                            we nevertheless add the mapping of the redirected response to the original link. This mapping
                                            may or may not be final. For example, in the case of WashingtonPost articles, when we encounter
                                            a CORS issue, we already have the final URL. However, in the case of links to BBC or NYT on Facebook, 
                                            because the links are shortened, we still do not have the final link when we encounter the CORS issue.
                                            All of these CORS blocked links will be later sent to the server so that the server can find the
                                            ultimate target link (since CORS is only imposed in browsers). We keep the mapping here nonetheless,
                                            because for paywalled articles, the server may not be able to get the redirected links (and rather
                                            get 403 for example).
